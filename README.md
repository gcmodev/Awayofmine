# A Way of Mine (An AI-Driven Game Demo)
Welcome to the repo of "A way of mine" game. This whole project is a bit of what i called a crazy experiment. the idea is to see if it's possible to build a complete, story driven indie game using the help of an AI (of course with hand touch).


# What the story’s about

there’s this small twilight village called glimmerbrook. it’s always kind of in between night and day, and the only thing that keeps it alive is this crystal called the heartlight. it glows based on people’s emotions — joy makes it brighter, sadness makes it dim.

you play as kai, a kid who’s part of this group called the hue-weavers — they make “echoes,” these emotional crafts that help balance the heartlight. the twist is kai can’t see colors like everyone else. they just feel emotions as vibrations.
so everyone kinda thinks kai’s broken, even though that’s not really true.

the demo is short — you basically go through kai’s day trying to fix a flicker in the heartlight. there’s a kid named ren who lost their wooden bird, and their sadness is making the light dim. you help them, and by the end you can either follow tradition or trust your own way of crafting emotion.

it’s not a big story, more like a small emotional moment.

# the goal (for now)
This demo is just the beginning. i’m not chasing perfection here. it’s more like:
can we use these new tools (gemini, pixellab, gpt, all that) to make something honest? something that still feels like it came from a human heart? after this, i kinda want to make a bigger version. maybe with a small team.
something where we expand the world, add more emotion-based gameplay, like crafting feelings or reading emotional “vibrations” through sound instead of color.

# Dev notes 
this repo’s probably gonna be messy.there’ll be builds that crash for no reason ( i guess?) i don’t know how big this’ll get.
maybe it stays small and quiet forever. maybe it turns into something more. maybe i meet more people who want to help build the next chapter.
there’s a lot of people to thank already.
especially one person who keeps giving me feedback and encouragement.
this whole thing probably wouldn’t even exist if i didn’t have someone saying “yeah, that sounds cool, go for it.”
if you found this repo randomly — hey.
thanks for reading this far. his isn’t a fancy devlog, you’ll probably see commits with names like “idk what this is” or “fix the thing again maybe,” because that’s just how it goes.
“A Way of Mine” is me learning to trust my own process, even if it doesn’t look like everyone else’s.
so yeah — that’s what this whole thing’s about.

and if one day someone plays it and feels a little less weird about doing things their own way, then maybe it worked.
