# A Way of Mine (An AI-Driven Game Demo)
Welcome to the repo of "A way of mine" game. This whole project is a bit of what i called a crazy experiment. the idea is to see if it's possible to build a complete, story driven indie game using the help of an AI (of course with hand touch).


#What the story’s about

there’s this small twilight village called glimmerbrook. it’s always kind of in between night and day, and the only thing that keeps it alive is this crystal called the heartlight. it glows based on people’s emotions — joy makes it brighter, sadness makes it dim.

you play as kai, a kid who’s part of this group called the hue-weavers — they make “echoes,” these emotional crafts that help balance the heartlight. the twist is kai can’t see colors like everyone else. they just feel emotions as vibrations.
so everyone kinda thinks kai’s broken, even though that’s not really true.

the demo is short — you basically go through kai’s day trying to fix a flicker in the heartlight. there’s a kid named ren who lost their wooden bird, and their sadness is making the light dim. you help them, and by the end you can either follow tradition or trust your own way of crafting emotion.

it’s not a big story, more like a small emotional moment.
