# A Way of Mine (An AI-Driven Game Demo)
Welcome to the repo of "A way of mine" game. This whole project is a bit of what i called a crazy experiment. the idea is to see if it's possible to build a complete, story driven indie game using the help of an AI (of course with hand touch).



This isn't the final game! Not even close. What you'll find here is the first 10-minute playable demo, concept to see if this wild idea will work. Almost everything from the concepts, the character dialogue, the GDScript code, and the pixel art will be generated using the AI help. I hope you will enjoy the game (although it is short).
Expect some bugs, if you have any ideas, or want to help me on expanding this game, let me know!
